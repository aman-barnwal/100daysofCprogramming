# 100 Days of C Programming

This repository documents my 100-day learning and practice journey in the C programming language.  
Each folder from Day01 to Day100 represents daily progress through hands-on coding and problem solving.

This project focuses on developing:
- Strong programming fundamentals
- Logic building
- Problem-solving ability
- File handling skills
- Understanding of structures and enums
- Basic data storage and binary file handling
